# Where is my package should check the status of the item. Where it is, when it will be arriving, etc.
# 2. Should give simply just the price and probably a break down of the cost.
# 3. Should have responses to fill in to create a shipment. These responses should be a listing of what is being shipped, where it goes, and who gets it.
# 4. Should return the package IDs of all packages in shipment
# 5. This exit should give an option to give feedback to the ChatBot and the services it provides.(Is it possible to hold the feedback so I can see it?)
